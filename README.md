#### Explanations of Technologies Used and Installation Instructions
A new technology that I learned and used during this project was a package called EmailJS. This package allowed for me to be able to send an email with the content of what a user typed into my input boxes on my website. To install this package I had to run "$ npm install emailjs-com --save" in my terminal then call upon it properly in my code when I wanted to use it. There was also a certain form I had to follow and setup so that the function that would send the email would run correctly.
